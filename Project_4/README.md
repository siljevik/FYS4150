# The Ising model in two Dimensions

The topic of this project is the Ising model in two dimensions. We will use this simple model to explore temperature-dependent behaviour in ferromagnets. A particular goal is to numerically estimate the critical temperature at which our 2D system undergoes a phase transition, from a magnetized phase to a phase with no net magnetization.

More code TBA

### Project focus

- The Markov Chain Monte Carlo method for sampling from probability distributions of many variables, and how the resulting samples can be used to approximate probability distributions and expectation values for derived quantities.
- Using parallelization to speed up our code.
