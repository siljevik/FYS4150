# Project 5 - Study of the double-slit-in-a-box setup, simulated using the two-dimensional Schr ̈odinger equation

The goal of this project is to simulate the two-dimensional time-dependent Schrödinger equation, and use it to study a double-slit-in-a-box setup and variations thereof. In short, you will write a simulation that can give results like this. (Note that you will not be required to animate your results, but it’s quite instructive and fun to do so.)

The key methodological aspects of the projects are:

- Understanding partial differential equations (PDEs)

- Applying the Crank-Nicolson method in 2+1 dimensions

- Working with complex numbers in code

- Getting them indices straight…

- Using conserved quantities as stability checks
