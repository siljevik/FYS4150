# Project 3 - Penning Trap

IMPORTANT: This folder (Project_3) only contains the txt, .py, and .svg files. The main files of the types .cpp and .hpp is in the folder called 'Proj_3_copy'

## Folder 8

### single_particle_z.txt
Made with the single_test.cpp

### single_particle_penning_t_z.py
Python code that plots for one particle in the penning trap with the single_particle_z.txt file.

### two_particle_penning_x_y.py
Plots the two particles' movement in the xy-plane, with and without interactions.

### two_particles_penning_traj.py
Plots the trajectories for two particles in the (x,v_x)- and (z,v_z)-planes, both with and without interactions.

### two_particle_3D.py
Python plot that plots the motion of two particles in the 3D-space, both with and wihtout interactions.
